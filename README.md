Next-Google was created to be a mimic of the infamous [Google](https://google.com) Search Homepage. It was created using React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and fully implements Google Search's REST Api in order to display search results to the user. The application was also built with design in mind, with the web app being fully responsive for desktop and mobile users. This was done using Media Queries, CSS Grid, and CSS Flexbox.
